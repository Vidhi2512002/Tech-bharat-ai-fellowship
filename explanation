# Telangana RTGS – Domestic Energy Consumption Analyzer

## Mission
Prototype a **Real-Time Governance System (RTGS)** that converts Telangana Open Data into **standardized, cleaned, and actionable evidence** for policymakers. This project provides a **command-line-first pipeline** to analyze electricity consumption data and surface clear insights.

## Objective
Create a **CLI-first agentic system** that:
- Ingests open government data
- Cleans and standardizes it for analysis
- Generates terminal-ready insights
- Produces policy-oriented recommendations

> **Scope (Current Prototype):**  
> June 2021 Domestic Consumption Data from the Telangana Open Data Portal.

---

## Features
- **Agent-based modular pipeline**: ingestion → standardization → cleaning → analysis → recommendations.
- **Automatic logging**: Each run creates a timestamped log file.
- **Terminal-friendly summary**: Clear output for quick policy briefings.
